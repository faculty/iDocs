+ **Dog** = **D**\ ata\ **o**\ logy\  **g**\ eek

    -- Yes, I am just eager to make this word 'Dog', without considering my essential profession, which is **''Computational Biology''**.


--------------------
Coffee or Tea
--------------------

You always need to take a rest whenever you struggle into a hard nut. 
Also, staying up all night to write a code always results in another daytime of debugging. 
Reading through a/an tough/insipid paper always bring you a period of boring time. 
All you need at this time is a cup of coffee/tea. **60%** of my colleagues favor one of them, **30%** like both, and the rest **10%** never need any, because they choose to take a (long) snap in the noon. 
Okay, I fake those numbers, because I am too lazy to do a survey. Nevertheless, you need water. At least, you need water.


--------------------------------------------------
Mathematics/Statistics, Computer, **and** Biology
--------------------------------------------------

Every one knowing **Computational Biology** knows its an *inter-discipline*, or I'd like to call it *edge discipline*. What's worse, this name trickily omits the feature relating to **Mathematics/Statistics**, which may scare lots of new hands. 
However, you will recognize that the majority of your time and energy are paid to play with *data* -- **HUGE**, **MESSY**, **BIOLOGICAL** data. 
In one word, to answer the **biological** question, **mathematics** helps you to analyze the data, and there are too much data so that you can not deal with a pencil and an A4 paper, so you need a **computer** to handle the calculation.

What's in this Blog
-----------------------

I'm not going to tell you how to choose your coffee or tea, although I start from this subject. Remember our key word -- **Dog**! You may find useful and practical skills, tools, and applications in catalogues of **computer**, , **mathematics/statistics**, and **biology**, here in the blog.
